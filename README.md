# moonloader
moonloader is a chrome extension (in development), allowing you to download youtube videos or even whole playlists in one step as mp4 in different qualities, mp3 or as gif (gif feature currently in development). 

Either download over the rocket app icon, which provides the main app with most customization or just use youtubes download - button, that now is changed by moonloader.

Keep in mind this app is still in development, there are known bugs. But for most users its core - elements should mostly work.

## how to implement
- **firstly set up your **own** nodejs - serve, featuring requests for downloading via yt-dl** \
copy paste the node.js code from ./nodejs/nodejs.js \
paste it in your nodejs index.js (e.g use free glitch.com hosting services) \
also include these extra files inside root-/main-folder\
add the described dependencies in the package .json\
use "start": "node index.js"\
disclaimer: mp4Status tickets are still a bit glitched, so sometimes they didn't get deleted --> fix planned for the future\

- **secondly the client - side stuff** \
download this repo and extract the moonloader folder containing all the important files (NOT the moonloader folder containing e.g LICENSE!) \
edit config.js and paste your node.js-server-adress (in glitch you can find it by clicking "Share" --> Live Site) as var nodejsURL \
now type chrome://extensions into ya chromium based browser (e.g chrome, edge, opea gx ... / not firefox ...) and enable developer mode
after that place ya extracted moonloader folder inside -- voil√†
